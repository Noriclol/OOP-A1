What did you learn? What did you know already?

doing these assignments there was a bunch i knew already, however. I had to reorient my self with c++ and pointers specifically. 
Doing these assignments has been a good way of accomplish that.

What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

i found filereading and pointers particularly difficult as i havent dealt with them in a while.
